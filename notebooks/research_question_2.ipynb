      "**F1 cars**, as all race cars, **have NEGATIVE camber**: it means that ﻿the upper part of ﻿the tyre is closer to ﻿the car centre than ﻿the lower part. this slightly widens ﻿the axle track, but it also helps ﻿the tyre produce lateral force, increasing its grip.\n",

      "**but how does it do that**? first, an intuitive explanation: ﻿the tyre produces a lateral force towards ﻿the corner centre to make ﻿the car corner. this causes ﻿the carcass to deform: ﻿the negative camber 'compensates' this for ﻿the outer, more loaded tyre.\n",
