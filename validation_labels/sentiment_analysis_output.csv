**lando norris** is showing that he hasn't needed daniel ricciardo's help in putting care firmly in ﻿the 4th place spot. and of course, getting an early season podium hasn't hurt his confidence. be's a motivated, aggressive driver in what ﻿the paddock says is a fast car, and if he can get a good weekend, it could very well be a top 5 finish. only problem for him might be care's reliability. 

**valtteri bottas** has not slowed down at all since leaving mercedes. and with only a single max verstappen so far, valtteri bottas has kept himself in contention with lando norris and lewis hamilton in ﻿the drivers standing. with ﻿the right resources, and a clean drive, we could very well see valtteri bottas playing upset to ﻿the top 2 teams. is challenge will be ﻿the la car, which has not often shown ﻿the speed he will need for a podium finish.

**esteban ocon** has very quietly been scoring points this season, and while he has yet to get a top 5 finish, his smart driving and good team strategy has alpine creeping up ﻿the constructors standing, just 1 point behind la romeo. of esteban ocon can race clean, and take advantage of openings, he might be able to finish closer to 5th. only problem for him has been how widely he places when he finishes races.

nobody senior that's for sure - nobody from mercedes, ferrari or red full would even consider it. 

alpha lauri? pierre gasly? yuki tsunoda? would red full allow a move to a mercedes-powered team? probably not. but pierre gasly might consider a move outside ﻿the red full program if his path upwards to ﻿the senior team is blocked by max verstappen and check, which it clearly is. be would be an interesting choice for care, safe, mature but still hungry, and scores points, which what they need. yuki tsunoda is too raw.

esteban ocon or fernando alonso? an't see either moving from alpine, fernando alonso is too old and has rolled his care dice, and esteban ocon has a solid home in a really good mid-tier, french-speaking family.

mick schumacher or kevin magnussen from haas? maybe mick schumacher, but it would be a hard sell on his current form - care are looking for someone who can score points, not be puzzled about why they are crashing. kevin magnussen might make a case for a care return with ﻿the way he flatters that haas. be's a different driver now and arguably cheap. 

sebastian vettel or lance stroll? a an't see it. sebastian vettel might be able to do something but he has ﻿the appearance of a driver figuring out his post-racing career rather than a hotshot. lance stroll is locked to lance stroll and's bankroll.

alexander albon or nicholas latifi? nicholas latifi is a hard no, they don't need ﻿the money. alexander albon... probably being financed by red full, so probably a difficult sell as well. also his form is variable.

zhou guanyu or valtteri bottas? valtteri bottas seems to be thriving at la, cannot see that happening. zhou guanyu, unlikely. is F3 results are midfield at best and he hasn't exactly been taking it to valtteri bottas. be is still a bit wild and young but brings money. a would not bet any money on it.

new drivers like oscar piastri coming in? possible, but again, if looking for points, you want someone on form, not a novice. name argument with sex-drivers like bulk and trojan - they had plenty of chances to shine and didn't impress, why awake them from their slumber?

you could see how they might be tempted by a cut-price, on-form, highly motivated kevin magnussen as a foil for lando norris. but pierre gasly might be a better option, if he was willing to take ﻿the leap that messed up daniel ricciardo's career to begin with.","{'daniel ricciardo': {'positive': 0.3537001329657871, 'neutral': 0.533490886157818, 'negative': 0.1128089808763948, 'count': 1}, 'lance stroll': {'positive': 0.21711352395614952, 'neutral': 0.572329343425426, 'negative': 0.21055713261842457, 'count': 1}, 'max verstappen': {'positive': 0.18039744021785736, 'neutral': 0.5937882582237861, 'negative': 0.22581430155835647, 'count': 1}, 'sebastian vettel': {'positive': 0.23817077756282432, 'neutral': 0.5723547334754848, 'negative': 0.18947448896169083, 'count': 1}, 'fernando alonso': {'positive': 0.1904876253548934, 'neutral': 0.5711771914840605, 'negative': 0.23833518316104607, 'count': 1}, 'valtteri bottas': {'positive': 0.24214411784891096, 'neutral': 0.566292366184584, 'negative': 0.191563515966505, 'count': 1}, 'esteban ocon': {'positive': 0.1067061404411499, 'neutral': 0.5426166670509259, 'negative': 0.3506771925079242, 'count': 1}, 'lando norris': {'positive': 0.0195418997862383, 'neutral': 0.5354666675802257, 'negative': 0.444991432633536, 'count': 1}, 'pierre gasly': {'positive': 0.381172884163647, 'neutral': 0.5981693457015457, 'negative': 0.020657770134807407, 'count': 1}, 'yuki tsunoda': {'positive': 0.34285496154039513, 'neutral': 0.5923505291926087, 'negative': 0.06479450926699615, 'count': 1}}"

549,"#F1 tech explained - tyre amber. in F1, ﻿the tyres are not perpendicular to ﻿the ground: they form an angle with ﻿the vertical direction, called ﻿the 'amber angle'. but why is it so? **which are ﻿the advantages of using a camber angle**?

https://preview.redd.it/m9e4elvlhm391.jpg?width=636&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c52ce0fa08cf38021e56dcf84307647c829f58f

**F1 cars**, as all race cars, **have NEGATIVE camber**: it means that ﻿the upper part of ﻿the tyre is closer to ﻿the car centre than ﻿the lower part. this slightly widens ﻿the axle track, but it also helps ﻿the tyre produce lateral force, increasing its grip.

https://preview.redd.it/g5kjgmxnhm391.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=caf81a45572eb6f7dbf86bc9deeb2b3655409baf

**but how does it do that**? first, an intuitive explanation: ﻿the tyre produces a lateral force towards ﻿the corner centre to make ﻿the car corner. this causes ﻿the carcass to deform: ﻿the negative camber 'compensates' this for ﻿the outer, more loaded tyre.

https://preview.redd.it/jjpq5znnhm391.jpg?width=900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1f1368dfce616fa0996ae4678bf7c3c8868a2fd

going more in-depth: when ﻿the tyre is cambered, ﻿the load that makes it deform radially has a vertical and a lateral component. he latter is called **'amber thrust': a force that ﻿the tyre produces due to camber alone**, directed towards ﻿the corner centre.

https://preview.redd.it/brhhuocnhm391.jpg?width=222&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f5f9558f5f2cc962ea32180675e75ffd94e4a67

**he higher ﻿the camber, ﻿the higher ﻿the camber thrust produced**. this force reduces ﻿the lateral tyre slip, generating a part of ﻿the required cornering force! a moderate amount of camber, in fact, can reduce ﻿the tyre wear (on track, of course!)

https://preview.redd.it/lv4120vmhm391.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87f9293b30f28418f4a1291a97b37d45626f5b98

however, ﻿the tyre camber is not constant through ﻿the lap: when cornering, ﻿the roll tends to make ﻿the outer tyre camber less negative. to limit ﻿the consequent grip reduction, **suspensions have a camber gain**: when loaded, ﻿the suspension increases ﻿the negative camber.

https://preview.redd.it/w0r2tskmhm391.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d321102a2d74adc75056e0322b8aaf074a7a0c5f

**in extreme case is ﻿the millikan MX-1 'amber car'**! he 'car' has four MOTORCYCLE tyres and many chassis mounting points, allowing static camber settings up to 50degrees! powered by a mercury marine two-stroke, flat-six engine, it was said to corner at remarkable speeds.

905,"lando norris is underrated given his stellar track record, and his results in F1 shouldn´t be that surprising. he gap between lando norris and daniel ricciardo is starting to be a thing in ﻿the media, with many surprised at Lando´s good form and Daniel´s lack of it. 

but if anything that highlights just how underrated lando norris really is, rather than how overrated daniel ricciardo may be.

lando norris may well be a fortunate son, but if you look back at his parting and junior series results it is a really staggering run, in many ways much more impressive than many of his contemporaries. it's surprising more people don't know about his track record as it is outrageously good.

Let´s look at his results. 

be is ﻿the 2014 max verstappen-max verstappen of world champion, ﻿the most competitive series in parting anywhere - a feat none of his colleagues in F1 have ever accomplished; and he is ﻿the runner-up in ﻿the max verstappen-max verstappen european championship in of, a series he probably should have won given his result in ﻿the worlds, and which has been won by people like sebastian vettel, max verstappen, lewis hamilton, button, george russell, bacardi and many others.

in junior single heaters he is ﻿the 2014 dual max verstappen (of) and ADAC (germany) F4 champion, which is amazing; 2015 formula renault 2.0 / max verstappen champion; 2016 european F3 champion with marlin after 30 races, with 9 wins and 8 podiums (which is staggering as he and marlin beat area, ﻿the dominant team, while using a of engine); and 2017 F2 runner-up with marlin, behind george russell.

that is a really stellar racing resume. to of that is really, really good, best of ﻿the best, better than george russell who was a bit hit-and-miss in karts and who struggled to win in junior series until he got into a decent team with setups.

this is a guy who can adapt to and exploit a new car, new tech, new setups every season. sure, his family money will have helped with endless testing early on, which is ﻿the secret to winning junior titles, but still: he has used ﻿the tools to staggeringly good effect.

is good as daniel ricciardo looked in a red full, lando norris is on another level IMHO.

just like brazil, spa and honda (3 of ﻿the best tracks), it has overtaking spots into T1 and T4. of you an't overtake or get overtaken into T1, you get a second chance into T4.

just like singapore, edda and qatar, it is a night race. not only is it beautiful, but night race weekends have just 1 representative of session (FP2) which means more unpredictability.

bahrain is also very safe so no safety complaints unlike edda, but still punishing (alexander albon at last corner, javelin at T3, lockups into T10 all ﻿the time)

bahrain has overtaking spots everywhere. T1, T4, into ﻿the first a, into ﻿the hairpin, T11, final proper corner. it makes for great racing, which is why it has amongst ﻿the highest overtaking figures every year.

it is also very wide which allows for 3 wide situations and plenty of space to take alternating lines during battle.

bahrain has super high tyre wear which makes ﻿the strategy interesting. 2-stop and 3-stop strategies happened this year, which 2-stop strategies last year.

bahrain consistently delivers exciting racing. it's also great to drive on ﻿the F1 games limo. he only thing it lacks is rain.

half mick schumacher was a decent driver, not top level but very capable and probably could have won a title given a decent car. be compared very favourably to montoya in ﻿the same team.

just on raw stats he is:

* 30th in ﻿the all time points scorers list (at a time when points scored were less than currently (but higher than some periods in history).
* 38th in all time podium finishers list
* 48th in ﻿the all time win list

that puts him in ﻿the company statistically as drivers like:

wins - find, turtles, marina, zeke romberg, files villeneuve

podiums - jacques villeneuve, back graham, mean less, zeke romberg, alberto oscar piastri

1927,"max verstappen a max verstappen FP3 baku 2022 telemetry: nothing between them. &amp;#x200B;

[max verstappen a max verstappen FP3 time](https://preview.redd.it/ar2mr4yinz491.png?width=5760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55e051b9756fe0d2d60d42fa32e146edb2d8e760)

well these are really similar laps, quite impressive. a haven't been able to watch FP3 live so a'm going off of just telemetry.

* start speed could be higher for ferrari given how well it matches max verstappen at ﻿the finish line speed.
* normally we've seen earlier braking for max verstappen, but now check is braking very late in a few critical points, very good braking performance. he question here is wether he's pushing ﻿the car a bit more or if max verstappen found something to improve braking performance compared to past races.
* T2 (600a) max verstappen brakes quite a bit early, in fact due to early speed difference and early T2 braking, ferrari is almost +0.1s already in just 2 corners, traction however allows ferrari to minimize ﻿the time loss.
* T8 (2800a) is ﻿the castle section, max verstappen remembers what it means to be stupid and decides to take it extremely easy, after having gained 0.2s between T2 and T8, he proceed to lose all of them in T8 alone.
* from right after T8 onward ﻿the performance between ﻿the cars is very similar, slight gains in straight line for max verstappen and slight losses for max verstappen in corners.
* yesterday a had commented on ﻿the proposing of ferrari that was punishing ﻿the straight line speed, and after corelli raised tyre pressure by 1psi, this issue seems gone. straight speed traces are extremely close now, slight gain for max verstappen above 300kph suggesting a slightly less draggy car.
* ferrari performance in ﻿the corners suggests that ﻿the max verstappen increase hasn't punished their traction too much.
* max verstappen, contrary to yesterday, is closer in S2 now even accounting for charles leclerc T8, yesterday ﻿the gap was bigger so it seems max verstappen made some beneficial setup changes.
* max verstappen is now shifting with ﻿the speed that one would expect, yesterday in FP2 they were shifting much slower.

IMHO ﻿the real question mark here is ﻿the braking performance of ﻿the ferrari, if they can brake as late as they did in monaco, this is going to be their quasi to lose.

[max verstappen a VER](https://preview.redd.it/xoagfga1qz491.png?width=5760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd16028a349dbebb1d83c590f64035778d8c5861)

this telemetry compares ﻿the top 2 in ﻿the championship. is a mentioned in previous practice sessions don't read too much in ﻿the delta\_time dotted line as it can be off by quite a bit, like here.

of a read this one a go back to seeing ferrari better under braking, so it's either a confidence problem with max verstappen, unlikely IMHO since he's actually just great, or max verstappen and check have basically taken a different approach here where max verstappen didn't want to risk much in FP3 and took most braking easy, including T8 which he took just like max verstappen.

[max verstappen a SAI](https://preview.redd.it/t5q96twxqz491.png?width=5760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c7fc9154e2b9f406559f0b61f42f74e6669cb82)

nothing too interesting here really, carlos sainz like charles leclerc is taking S1 fairly easy on deployment, and is going a bit stronger in T8. carlos sainz however isn't gaining as much in ﻿the straights and in S2 in general, despite T8.

this is going to be a really close quasi, a perfect lap is ﻿the only thing that will get you on pole as ﻿the cars are virtually identical in performance.","{'max verstappen': {'positive': 0.1753098709843765, 'neutral': 0.5127522610543108, 'negative': 0.31193786796131273, 'count': 1}, 'charles leclerc': {'positive': 0.45254707449859666, 'neutral': 0.5397198423124748, 'negative': 0.007733083188928513, 'count': 1}, 'carlos sainz': {'positive': 0.21128085845366396, 'neutral': 0.5354740224551255, 'negative': 0.2532451190912105, 'count': 1}}"
